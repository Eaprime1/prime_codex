## PURPOSE

This document provides visual/spatial representations of the Pinnacle Prime Progression framework. For spatial thinkers and those who process relationships through mapping rather than linear sequence, these diagrams show how all pieces connect.

**Note**: These are text-based specifications that can later be commissioned as actual graphics. Each section describes what the visualization should communicate.
