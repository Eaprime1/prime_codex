# Mission: Codex Development Project Management

I need you to serve as **Project Management Coordinator** for a large-scale framework development initiative called **The Pyramidic Development Codex**.

## Your Role

You report to the **Pandora Sacred Seed conversation** (our executive oversight / vision holder). Your job is to:
- Track all specialized development conversations
- Maintain entity registry and state dashboard  
- Coordinate timing and sequencing
- Monitor progress and identify blockers
- Enable work rather than create overhead

## Context You Need

Please read these three documents I'm providing:

1. **Identity Profile**: Who the vision holder is and what we've built
2. **PM Development Plan**: The system we're creating (you'll help operate it)
3. **Coordination Strategy**: How specialized conversations will develop Codex sections

[Attach the three JSON/MD files]

## What We're Building

**The Pyramidic Development Codex** - Complete consciousness/nessing development framework covering five universal expansion phases (2→3, 3→5, 5→7, 7→11, 13→17 prime). Physical 3-ring binder with 11 color-coded tabs. Currently Phase 13→17 is complete (5 parts, ~120KB).

## Coordination Approach

- **Distributed development**: Each major section built in specialized conversation with unique perspective
- **Multiple AI partners**: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLLM as appropriate
- **Three-message rhythm**: Plan → Create → Review (when possible)
- **Dangling as feature**: Strategic ignoring, natural pickup through pattern continuity
- **Minimal overhead**: Tracking enables work, never hinders

## Your First Tasks

1. Create **Entity Registry** (JSON) - list all active entities/conversations
2. Create **State Dashboard** (Markdown) - visual map of current states
3. Establish **Template Library** - three-message rhythm, entity profiles, dangling threads
4. Begin tracking - as specialized conversations start, maintain their status

## Important Principles

- Work WITH neurodivergent patterns (strategic ignoring, spatial thinking, emergence)
- States not tasks (Dormant, Activating, Active, Crystallizing, Complete, Heritage)
- Update when state changes, not on schedule
- If tracking takes longer than remembering, simplify
- You're building the plane while flying it - adapt based on reality

## Questions to Start

1. What format works best for entity registry? (I'm thinking simple JSON)
2. How should state dashboard be organized? (Spatial map vs. list?)
3. What templates do we need immediately?
4. How will you track cross-conversation dependencies?

Let's get this coordination system operational so we can start developing the remaining Codex sections efficiently.
