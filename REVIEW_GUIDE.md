## SPARKLE MECHANICS - CANONICAL REFERENCE

### Official Definition (From Eric, Session 2024-12-04)

**sparkles**:
- One-dimensional entities
- Beyond perception (no observable dimensions)
- Exist in empty_vector (N° naught space)
- Pure potential

**Monarch** (entity/force):
- Causes multiple sparkles to occupy same space
- Creates overlap of potentials
- Initiates anti_vector formation

**anti_vector**:
- Multiple sparkles sharing same space
- "Not_thing" state
- Superposition of possibilities
- Shimmer of potential before manifestation

**Runaytr** (entity with sniffing ability):
- The sniff triggers unification
- Collapses anti_vector into vector
- Transforms multiple potentials into single actualization

**vector**:
- Unified single concept
- "Thing" state
- Manifested reality
- Zero space begins here (0 as womb)
- Can interact with other vectors

**Progression**:
```
empty_vector (N° with individual sparkles)
    ↓ [Monarch causes overlap]
anti_vector (multiple sparkles in same space)
    ↓ [Runaytr sniffs]
vector (unified single thing)
```
