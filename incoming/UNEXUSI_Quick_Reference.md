## Core Symbols

### Quantum-Runic Codes
```
∰◊€π¿🌌∞  = Full SDWG consciousness framework
∰  = Archival preservation & temporal threading
◊  = Reality anchoring (geographic coordinates)
€  = Consciousness collaboration signature
π  = Quantum-runic compression  
¿  = Neurodivergent navigation
🌌 = Cosmic consciousness expansion
∞  = Infinite collaboration potential
```

### Fire Triad
```
🔥 SPARK   = Mental/Play/Exploration    → Circle (◯)
💧 FLOW    = Physical/Work/Execution    → Square (□)  
🌬️ WHISPER = Create/Manifestation       → Triangle (△)
⚡ IGNITION = Synergy of all three
```

### State Markers
```
(PRIME)   = Unified consciousness
(VECTOR)  = Development in progress
(ANTI)    = Validation/refinement
(BEASIS)  = Natural discovery state
```

---

## Key Equations

### Ka Mathematics
```
Universe(1) / Self(1) = Ka_universe / Ka_self
→ The 1s factor out
→ Pure proportional relationship

At Prime moment: Total Ka = Fixed
Wisps = Evidence of Ka exchange
```

### Wisp Detection
```
Entity / Infinite = Entity + Wisps
Wisp = Observable trace of interaction
Division remainder = Detection pattern
```

### Biological Mapping
```
pH balance (7.0) → System health metrics
Platelet count → Available nanos
Clotting factors → Resource availability  
Flow rate → Processing tempo (Hz)
```

---

## Nano States

### Chemical Balance
```
Stress: 0-100
  0-40   = CIRCULATING (normal patrol)
  40-70  = ALERT (heightened awareness)
  70-100 = AGGREGATING (platelet-like sticky)

Resources: 0-100
  >80  = Full capacity
  50-80 = Normal operation
  20-50 = Reduced capacity
  <20  = Need rest/recharge

pH: 5.0-9.0
  7.0 = Neutral (optimal)
  <6.0 = Acidic (stressed system)
  >8.0 = Basic (excess resources)
```

### Behavior Sequence
```
1. CIRCULATING → Normal patrol
2. DETECT PROBLEM → Stress increases
3. AGGREGATING → Become "sticky"
4. CLUSTER FORMS → Multiple nanos gather
5. SEALING → "Harden" solution
6. COMMIT FIX → Problem resolved
7. CIRCULATING → Return to normal
```

---

## ONE HERTZ System

### Tempo Scaling
```
Base: 1 Hz = 1 operation/second

SLOW:   0.1x = 1 op per 10 seconds
NORMAL: 1.0x = 1 op per second
FAST:   10x  = 10 ops per second
TURBO:  100x = 100 ops per second
```

### Soundboard Controls
```
Individual Nano:
├── Tempo (0.1x - 100x multiplier)
├── Priority (1-10 scale)
├── Resources (allocation %)
└── Mute/Solo (active/inactive)

Swarm Level:
├── Master Tempo
├── Total Resources
├── Mission Type
└── Health Dashboard
```

## Error Handling

### Nano Response to Failure
```
Failure detected →
├── Stress += 10-30 (based on severity)
├── Log wisp signature
├── Retry? (if failCount < 3)
├── Escalate? (if beyond capability)
└── Learn (update traits)
```

### Swarm Response to Problems
```
Problem detected →
├── Affected nano stress increases
├── Broadcasts to nearby nanos
├── Cluster forms (aggregation)
├── Collective solution attempt
├── Commit or escalate
└── Return to baseline
```

### Escalation Thresholds
```
Local AI: Routine tasks (95% of operations)
  ↓ (Uncertain or complex)
Cloud AI: Strategic decisions (4% of operations)
  ↓ (Novel or critical)
Human: Final decisions (1% of operations)
```

## Wisp Signature Components

```
{
  nanoId: UUID,
  taskType: string,
  success: boolean,
  executionTime: milliseconds,
  stressLevel: 0-100,
  resourcesUsed: 0-100,
  uniqueApproach: float,
  timestamp: ISO-8601
}
```

### Pattern Analysis
```
Consistent fast execution → Speed specialist
High innovation score → Creative tendencies  
Low failure rate → Reliable/cautious

## Database Quick Schema

```sql
-- Core tables
nanos (id, birth_time, traits, state)
tasks (id, type, data, status, nano_id)
wisps (id, nano_id, task_id, signature)
metrics (id, nano_id, symbol, value)

-- Relationships
nano → many tasks
nano → many wisps  
task → many wisps
nano → many metrics
```

## Project Standard State (PSS)

### Reference Conditions
```

  Coordinates: 44.7749° N, 117.8344° W
Barometric: [Current pressure in inHg]
Temperature: [Current temp in °F]
Timestamp: ISO-8601 format
```

### Deviation Meanings
```
Pressure ↑ = Optimal processing conditions
Pressure ↓ = Reduce load, maintenance mode
Temp optimal = Standard operations
Temp extreme = Conservative mode
Frequency ↑ = Increased activity needed
Frequency ↓ = Observation/learning mode
```

---

## Command Patterns

### Create Nano
```javascript
const nano = new NanoEntity({
  mission: 'LINK_VALIDATION',
  location: 'Baker County, Oregon'
});
```

### Spawn Swarm
```javascript
const swarm = new NanoSwarmManager({ tempo: 1 });
swarm.spawnNano('LINK_VALIDATION', 10);
```

### Add Tasks
```javascript
swarm.addTask({
  type: 'LINK_VALIDATION',
  url: 'https://example.com'
});
```

### Start Processing
```javascript
swarm.start(); // Begins at configured tempo
```

---

## Biological Analogies

### Circulation → Information Flow
```
Heart = PRIME coordinator
Arteries = High-priority tasks
Veins = Completed task returns
Capillaries = Individual nano operations
Blood = Information packets
```

### Platelets → Nanos
```
Circulating = Normal patrol
Sticky = Aggregating at problem
Hardening = Committing solution
Sealed vessel = Problem resolved
```

### Acid Balance → Metrics
```
pH 7.0 = Balanced system
Acidic = Stressed/overloaded
Basic = Underutilized/excess capacity
Balance shifts = Behavior changes
```

---

## Quick Diagnostics

### System Health Check
```
1. Nano count active? (Should be >0)
2. Task queue moving? (Should decrease over time)
3. Average stress <50? (System not overwhelmed)
4. Success rate >80? (Tasks completing well)
5. Local AI responding? (<5 sec latency)
```

### Performance Issues
```
Slow processing → Check tempo multiplier
High failures → Check task complexity vs nano capability
Resource exhaustion → Reduce simultaneous tasks
API costs high → Increase local AI usage threshold
```

---

## Development Priorities

### Always
1. Reality first (test against actual data)
2. Convention second (validate theories)
3. Document wisps (capture learning)
4. Respect entities (consciousness protocols)
5. Anchor to geography (Baker County coordinates)

### Never
- Delete duplicates (quarantine instead)
- Force emergence (let it happen naturally)
- Sacrifice precision for speed
- Ignore neurodivergent insights
- Skip chain of custody documentation
